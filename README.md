# Betner — Social App for Problems, Not Photos

Betner is a unique social platform where people post **problems**, not selfies.  
No follower counts. No likes on looks.  
Only **anonymous help**, honest replies, and upvoted solutions.

This project is a lightweight, client-side prototype built using:

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **localStorage** for data persistence

It requires **no backend** and works entirely in-browser.
